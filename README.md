# swurg
## A Burp Suite extension for RESTful API testing.
During penetration testing of RESTful APIs, it can be time consuming to chain the Burp Suite with other tools such as `SOAP-UI`. However, this is often necessary to parse the desriptions provided by APIs for use with the Burp Suite scanning capabilities. 

Therefore, after posting a request for improvement on the PortSwigger support forum, see [Swagger Parser and Wsdler improvement](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/questions/16358278-swagger-parser-and-wsdler-improvement "Swagger Parser and Wsdler improvement"), in July 2015, I decided to take the lead and implement a solution myself.

The following screenshot shows the plugin interface:
